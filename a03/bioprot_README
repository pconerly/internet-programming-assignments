#This api mashup does a search on the NCBI using the API utility to get
#amino acid sequence data.

#Then the program runs the AA sequence through a dictionary to find the
#hydrophobicity of each residue.

#Finally it uses google charts to create a graph of the hydrophobicity of
#the amino acid chain.
